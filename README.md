# MLOps Project

## Dataset
- **Toy Dataset**: This project uses a dataset on US Visa applications to predict binary approval outcomes [0,1].
  - [EasyVisa_Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

## Purpose
- **Project Goal**: This repository is intended to illustrate the organization of an MLOps project with a focus on:
  - **Prototyping**: Transitioning from AI research experiments code to MLOps prototyping.
  - **Modular Design**: Structuring AI research code experiments into modular components, adhering to MLOps principles.
  - **Reproducibility**: Enhancing reproducibility using MLOps principles.

## Experiment Modular Flow - Understanding.
- **Flowchart**: The modular flow of the experiment is documented in the flowchart:
  - /flowcharts/MLOPs-flow.pdf

## Pending Work
- **Custom Reports**: Exploring or developing custom reports for various algorithms (ML, DL) across different data types (tabular, text, signal, image) to aid in debugging AI model development and understanding its evolution.

## Future Work
- **Model Monitoring**: Implementing monitoring tools to track model performance post-deployment in/for real-life scenarios.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Setting up CI/CD pipelines to automate the deployment process.
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Adding automated hyperparameter tuning for different architectures.
